=================
This project fetches the top users on Stack Overflow using their API and displays them in a table. Images are cached both in memory and on disk for performance and persistence.

Separation of network and MVC layers is demonstrated here, in addition to coding organization, style and adherence to iOS best practices such as utilizing standard frameworks and patterns, and avoiding retain cycles.
